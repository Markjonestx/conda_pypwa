This little project is shared under the BSD Clause 3 license. I request that
you submit any fixes back to this repo so that others can use your fixes, 
whether you are using the scripts contained here for your own project or to
compile PyPWA and its dependencies. If ever requested I may even split this
repo into multiple repos for each of the dependencies themselves.
